# sqlalchemy-challenge

In this week's challenge, we take a look at the temperature in Hawaii up until the year 2017. We mostly focused on the Year 2016 and 2017 to determine when the best time to go on vacation would be. We created a session in python, and pulled up data from a sqlite table. 
We then created an API showing information about precipitation, stations, and temperature observations. We also created a path to find the min, max, and average temperature for a specific date(s).
